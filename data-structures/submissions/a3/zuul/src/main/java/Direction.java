public enum Direction {

/**
 * This enum comes from my initial confusion about the
 * subtask when it asked to streamline things
 * with a HashMap. Instead, I just used this enum to
 * support multiple variants of a direction.
 *
 * For example, "north" and "n" are valid 'second words'
 * to go north.
