# A02: Advanced Personal Finance Tracker (student ver.)

---

**Objective:**

In this task, you will develop a **Personal Finance Tracker** in C that allows users to track income and expenses while maintaining a **linked list of transactions**. The program will **read previous logs from a file and store transactions in a linked list**, enabling users to modify the list before saving updates back to the file.

Additionally, you must create a **Makefile** to automate the compilation process. The output executable must be named **`fintrack`**.

**Folder Structure & File Organization**

Your project should be organized as follows:

```
/                     # Root project directory
├── dist/             # Distribution folder (final ZIP file will be here)
│   ├── fintrack.zip
├── release/          # Executable location
│   ├── fintrack
├── src/              # Source code files
│   ├── main.c        # Main program entry point
│   └── *.c           # Additional source files (to be created by student)
├── include/          # Header files
│   └── *.h           # Header files (to be created by student)
├── logs/             # Transaction logs
│   ├── transaction_log.txt
├── report/           # Documentation folder
│   ├── summary.pdf   # Student's project summary report
├── Makefile          # Build automation script
```

**Folders Structure:**

- **`src/`** → Contains all .c source files.
- **`include/`** → Contains all .h header files.
- **`logs/`** → Stores the transaction log file (transaction_log.txt). The program should read from and write to this file.
- **`release/`** → Stores the compiled executable (fintrack).
- **`dist/`** → Stores the final ZIP file containing the required files for submission.
- **`Makefile`** → Automates the compilation process and ensures a structured build.

**Requirements**

**1. Initial Setup**

- At the start of the program, ask the user if they want to **resume a previous session** by reading the transaction log (logs/transaction_log.txt).
- If resuming, read the previous transactions from the file and store them in a **linked list**.
- If no log file exists, start with an empty linked list.

**2. Transaction Management (Using a Linked List)**

- The program must maintain all transactions dynamically using a **linked list**.
- Users can **insert** a new transaction at any position (beginning, middle, or end).
- Users can **delete** any specific transaction by its position in the list.
- Transactions should not be immediately written to the file—only updated in the **linked list** while the program is running.

**3. User Commands**

The program should provide the following commands:

1. **`add income`** – Add an income transaction (with a description and amount). After adding, displays whether the user is within budget or in debt.
2. **`add expense`** – Add an expense transaction (with a description and amount). After adding, displays whether the user is within budget or in debt.
3. **`delete <position>`** – Remove a transaction from the linked list (position is based on list order).
4. **`print`** – Display all transactions in the linked list.
5. **`quit`** – Save all transactions to `logs/transaction_log.txt` and exit the program.

**4. File Handling**

- **Transactions should only be written to the log file when the user quits.**
- If the program stops unexpectedly, the log file should **remain unchanged**.
- When quitting, **overwrite the existing log file** with the latest linked list data.

**5. Transaction Display Format**

- The print command should display transactions with symbols indicating modifications:
- **`+++ i`** → Newly inserted transactions (not yet saved to the file).
- **`--- d`** → Transactions marked for deletion (removed from the linked list but not yet from the file).
- Ensure a **clear and structured output format** (see sample below).

**6. Input Validation (Must be Robust)**

- **Reject negative values** for income and expenses.
- **Reject non-numeric inputs** for amounts.
- **Handle invalid delete positions gracefully** (e.g., deleting an out-of-range entry should not crash the program).

**7. Makefile Requirement**

You must create a **Makefile** that:

- Compiles all .c files and generates an executable named **fintrack** in the release/ directory.
- Supports make clean to remove all .o files and the executable.
- Supports `make dist` to create a ZIP archive (dist/fintrack.zip) containing src/, include/, logs/transaction_log.txt, report/, and Makefile.
- Running `make` without arguments should execute clean, compile the executable, and create the distribution ZIP.

**8. Code Structure and Organization**

- **Split code into multiple files** (.c and .h files) and organize them into folders (src/, include/).
- Use **descriptive function and variable names**.
- Include **comments** explaining the purpose of functions and structures.
- Ensure the program is **modular and professional**—this will be part of your grade.

**9. Submission Requirements**

- Submit all **source files** via GitHub Classroom.
- Include a **PDF report** explaining how the program works:
- Describe the **linked list implementation** and its advantages.
- Showcase all **features** implemented.
- Include screenshots or logs demonstrating program behavior
