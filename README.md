# muic-archive
An archive of most (code) work done in my major courses.
## Notes
**Some classes do not have in-class exercises or are missing entirely.** This is due to my SSD failing, meaning that these do not exist in my laptop anymore. They are likely still up for download in Canvas or similar, but I have no plans to do that as of now.

Here are some notable missing files:
- Numerical Computation
    - In-Class Exercises
- System Skills and Low Level Programming
    - In-Class Exercises
- Database Foundations
    - Assignments
    - In-Class Exercises
- Functional and Parallel Programming
    - In-Class Exercises
